Scientist and Dungeon Master. Seeking to bring a little more science into your gaming

### More Information

My background ranges from molecular evolutionary theory to clinical genomics in
humans. I did my PhD work studying the mechanisms
underlying functional divergence in proteins and developing new phylogenomic
techniques for studying this process. I then did a Post-Doctoral Fellowship searching for genetic mutations
underlying rare Mendelian diseases in Atlantic Canada. I have since gone on to do Clinical Bioinformatics and Personalized medicine in cancer care.

I started playing AD&D 2nd Edition back in the 1990s as a teenager, mostly in my basement or that of a friend. I eventually went on to 3rd and 3.5, and dabbled in Star Wars d20 while I was in University. After finishing my undergraduate degree I didn't play D&D again until 2016, when a friend asked me if I would run a game again. I picked up 5th edition, loved it, and haven't looked back.
