title: The High Marches

The High Marches is a Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition campaign being run in the West Marches style. If you are wondering what a West Marches style campaign is, I would direct you to a great video by Matt Colville on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAC-gBoX9k), which is the video that taught me about this type of game. In brief this type of campaign structure is designed to address some of the issues many of us have gaming, particularly as adults in the modern world:

1. Busy schedules that may change week to week
2. Commitment to a long-running weekly campaign may be daunting
3. We may have many friends we would like to game with, but don't have the time to run multiple campaigns

It also really addresses the issue of people showing up to play just because "it is game night" but maybe don't have a lot of investment that night for whatever reason. It achieves these things by generally having a large roster of players, and adventure selection/game session scheduling both being very player driven. So you may have, say 12-16 players, they are aware of various potential adventure hooks: rumours, leads, job postings on the local jobs board, etc. Or they may just decide they want to go investigate an area on their map called The Shadow Forest. A few players (usually 4-6 for a good sized D&D group) schedules a time with the DM and goes off on that adventure. This structure lends itself well to an episodic campaign.

In my case this set up was appealing because I wanted to give players a sandbox to adventure in, while still having some lead time to prepare specific areas or adventures. I also started to make more and more friends who were gaming or interested in gaming, and my first campaign has ballooned to 7-8 player's. Anyone who has run a campaign with a large table knows it gets challenging to design encounters, give all characters their share of the spotlight, and run combat encounters efficiently. Small groups run much better. Throw in random "adulting" and people with erratic schedules and it is a recipe for having to adjust a lot of things on the fly. I also didn't want to run 2-3 parallel campaigns. So instead when I wrapped up my first campaign since I had come back to the fold I started planning a new one, which I set up in the West Marches style, and decided I could usually run up to 2 different sessions in a given week.

I had also been reading a lot of different games. In particular 13th Age, and started seeing many different mechanics I wanted to incorporate in my game. From 13th Age I was most interested in One Unique Thing and Icons. With Uniques not being much of a mechanic, but something interesting for players when building their characters, and Icons being a way of really tying characters to story with an in-game mechanic. In particular, I use it to shape adventures based on Icon relationship roles of the players. I'll talk a little more about those mechanbics and how I use them in the High Marches, along with some examples, in my next post.
